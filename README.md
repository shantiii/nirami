Intial inspriation, thet route from the coffee shop to the house

"turn left at the hedge, pass the library on the right, turn some direction,

Given these directions, can you find the coffee shop?

As the player sets out they encounter obstacles; the malevolent gazebos of  the locals
and challenges
